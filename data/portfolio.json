      "details": "This thesis addresses the growing threat of deepfake technology to digital security. A hybrid architecture was designed, integrating EfficientNet-B1 for feature extraction with a Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for context modeling. The system was trained on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF(v2), and tested on DeepFakeDetection (DFD) to evaluate generalization. The web-based system, built with Flask, allows users to upload videos, analyze them, and view detection results with confidence scores, confusion matrices, and batch evaluation. Results achieved an AUC of 92.35% and a video-level F1-score of 83.62%, while maintaining high computational efficiency (0.349 GFLOPs per frame).",

I implemented a Content-Based Filtering model by generating embeddings from book metadata (title, author, genres) and storing them in ChromaDB for efficient similarity searches. Additionally, I developed a Collaborative Filtering model by creating a user-book interaction matrix and using cosine similarity for book recommendations and an SVD model for user-based suggestions. The entire system was served via a RESTful API built with Python and FastAPI, which I then containerized and deployed on Google Cloud Platform.",

Initially, I built a prototype dashboard using Python Dash for daily transactions, later revised to Power BI for monthly reporting and richer insights. The Power BI dashboard featured multiple pages, including an overview, transaction types, transfers, bill payments, product payments, and unit performance (branch comparison). I also ensured automation of data pipelines using UiPath to maintain accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing manual work and human errors. This project improved decision-making for management by enabling real-time, accurate, and visually intuitive data monitoring.",
